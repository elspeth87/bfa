## Cry of the Mountains

> It was during Greengrass that the cries were first heard. They started so softly that the people in the towns and villages near the Spindles couldn't hear them over the sounds of their own merriment. 
> 
> But soon they grew in volume and in agitation until everyone stopped to listen. 
> 
> "It is the wind," the old folks said, waving their hands. "When it howls through the mountains it always makes that sound." 
> 
> But the young people knew that wasn't true. Many chose to ignore it, but a scarce few set out to find the source of the cries. 
> 
> Several days later, the cries stopped, but the young people never returned. 
> 
> Decades passed, and the old folks passed on. Soon the young folks were old, and one Greengrass, when they heard the cries from the mountains they knew what to say. 
> 
> "It is the wind. When it howls through the mountains it always makes that sound." 
> 
> There are many morals that could be taken from this tale, about listening to our elders or minding our own business, but this author would leave you with this:
> 
> Not everything that cries in need of rescue; when the mountains cry, you should run. 

## Where Rivers Met

> There is a place East of the Spindles where two rivers meet, channelling their icy waters into a single torrent which carves the land in two. 
> 
> It was from across these two rivers that Anni first saw Anlan. From the first time she saw him, she fell in love, as though a mystical force had brought her to this point and shown her her soulmate. 
> 
> Even an Orc would have struggled to cross these rivers, and for a Halfling like Anni, she knew it would have been a death sentence. Instead she shouted across the rivers to him and was delighted when he shouted back. 
> 
> Every day both Halflings returned to their spots on either side of the rivers, shouting across greetings and learning about each other. 
> 
> Anlan was a farmer's son, whose sheep liked to graze the area close to the southern river. 
> 
> Anni was the daughter of a local scribe, but had no head for writing so was allowed to wander where she would until they could find a husband for her. 
> 
> Anni and Anlan talked every day for six months, from The Claw of Sunsets through to The Fading. 
> 
> It was the day before Harvestide when Anlan told Anni the fateful news. His father had been killed by the order of the new Ardadian leader, for being a halfling who dared to own a business. Anlan and his mother had plans to move East with his younger sisters, across the Emerrane Pass. He told Anni he loved her but that she was safest where she was, north of the river and away from Ardad. 
> 
> But Anni wasn't going to let her love leave so easily. She pursuaded him to meet her at this very spot at midday on Harvestide with his family. Everyone would be busy with the feast and while people weren't looking, she would help them. 
> 
> The next day, Anlan returned with his mother and sisters. They had all of their belongings tied to their backs. They stared in amazement at what they saw. All of Anni's village had come out to help them, using a makeshift boat and a pulley system which Anni had designed, they crossed over both rivers safely. 
> 
> Anni and Anlan were married later that year, during the Drawing Down, and spent the next century helping those of smaller stature escape Ardad. They died peacefully in their home one summer day in 157 DR, one unwilling to live without the other. 

## How the Highlands Died

> When the world was younger than it is now, there was a garden. It was thick and green and covered many hundreds of miles of land. It was beautiful. The sort of place the sun never set and the gods smiled upon. 
> 
> Then the people came. They were jealous and greedy and unable to be happy with what they had. 
> 
> They saw the garden as something to be shaped and molded rather than something which was already complete. And as they tried to change it to their own ideals, the garden tried to fight back. But it was just a garden and not used to the extreme violence and reckless destruction wrought by the people. 
> 
> Slowly, the garden died. It withered beneath the angry hands of the people who sought to shape ot for themselves, who couldn't see the beauty that was already there. 
> 
> But the garden wasn't done fighting. With its last breath, the garden shook the world, pushing mountains from the ground and toppling the buildings of men. 
> 
> This is how the Spindles were born and how the highlands died.
