## The Rich Maiden

> Stories tell of a rich maiden from near Spinelock who was betrowthed (some say unwillingly) to an old rich merchant from the city of Greenlow (which is now part of Ardad). On her journey south, she and her entourage stopped at the forest foot of the Lisle Hills.
> 
> When they awoke the next morning, the maid was gone. A young boy named Thornyl claimed she was stolen by fairies, although no one believed him. 
> 
> The merchant from Greenlow, furious that his wife-to-be had runaway and renegged on their deal, vowed vengence on the people of Spinelock. Being rich, he could afford the best sellswords from the walled citadel of Gildenham and being old he valued nothing more than his pride. Soon, an army rode north from the citadel through the lands towards Spinelock. 
> 
> Following the same route his bride had taken, the old merchant and his men made their way through the forest at the foot of the Lisle Hills. The woods were thick and seemingly inpenetrable, but men will do anything for money or pride. And these men were determined. They would not let the forest stop them. 
> 
> When they reached the foot of the Lisle Hills the vegetation was so thick they could barely see their hands in front of their faces. But they heard a voice speaking through the forest. "Now is your chance. Turn back. You tried to take what was already mine. You will not be warned again." 
> 
> The old rich merchant laughed, believing the voice to belong to someone sent from Spinelock to stop him. He told them he would not be scared away. That he had come to claim his wife and he would take her by force if he needed to. 
> 
> Suddenly the forest gaveway, allowing the merchant and his men to see a frozen lake, which no one has seen before or since. In the middle of the frozen lake stood the rich maided, dressed in a gown of purest white with golden ribbons in her hair. Next to her stood a tall man, the likes of which the merchant had never seen before. 
> 
> The man spoke with the same voice that had warned him before. "She cannot be your wife, for she is mine. You have been warned to turn back. I will not ask politely again." 
> 
> Furious at the tall man's statement, the merchant charged forward, as if to grab the maiden from the ice where she stood. Before he could reach her, the ice beneath him fell away, plunging him into the freezing depths of the water, before closing up above him leaving him trapped and drowning. 
> 
> This time, it was the young maiden who spoke, not to the merchant, but the men he'd paid to capture her. "Return to the city and you will be paid. Your job here is done. Tell my father I am happy and well. My husband loves me and will always keep me safe." 
> 
> With that, the tall man clicked his fingers and the pair vanished before their eyes. 


## The Farlight Tree

Sarod Lisle, a half-orc wizard lived at the foot of the hills, was working on creating an artifact that would allow someone to change the course of history. 

Jealous of Lisle's reknown and wanting the artifact for himself, a human warlock called Letholdus Cloudfang travelled from across the Emerrane Pass to kill Lisle. 

While working in Klalport, Alys Farlight, a 17 year old human prostitute, overheard Letholdus Cloudfang asking about the whereabouts of Sarod Lisle. Determind to warn someone who was working towards the betterment of the area about the oncoming threat, she fled Klalport, but Cloudfang heard and followed. 

He finally caught her in the Maidrich Forest, before she could warn Lisle and trapped her spirit in this tree. 

Cloudfang surprised Lisle at his home in the Maidrich Forest and a mage war broke out, both men and the artifact were destroyed, taking the ability to use magic in the area with them. 

Alys' spirit makes itself known if someone calls for her and on the new moon. 

## The Standing Circle

> No one knows why the standing stones were erected. Most are wise enough not to question it. 
> 
> A woodsman, called Rulf Redstream, was not so wise. 
> 
> He saw how beautiful the light was where the stone circle stood and decided it would be the perfect place to build a house and raise a family. So he tried to move the stones. 
> 
> The first men he asked to help him told him he shouldn't do it. That he was meddling with things he shouldn't be and that bad things would happen if he continued. 
> 
> But Rulf was stubborn and he did not heed their warning. 
> 
> The second group of men he asked to help him were from south of Lake Astria and they didn't know about the standing circle. But when they arrived at the spot, they felt the power of the space and refused to touch them. 
> 
> Still determined, Rulf tried to move them himself. Every time he tried to push the stones, his blood felt like fire. After an hour of trying he collapsed in exhaustion at the foot of one of the stones, and never woke up. 
> 
> A week later his bones were found, bleached by the sun, where he fell.
