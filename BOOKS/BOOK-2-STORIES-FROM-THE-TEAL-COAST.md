## Cliffs of Tears

> One day a fisherman was in his boat off the coast when he saw a beautiful woman trapped at the bottom of the cliffs. Carefully, he navigated his boat over to her and rescued her. 
> 
> She told him her name was Camellia Rainbowcurl and that she was a fairy from another realm, trying to find her way home. 
> 
> The fisherman laughed at her tale, took her home with him and married her. Other people in the village commented that his wife was strange and that she never laughed, but the fisherman didn't mind. He liked his wife. 
> 
> Within five years they had two children, and the fisherman didn't think his life could be any better. 
> 
> One day, he was in his boat and he recognised the cliffs where he'd found his wife. He was shocked to see his wife and children standing on top of them. As he watched, they stepped closer to the edge. 
> 
> "Wait!" He cried out. "Wife, what are you doing? Get back from there!" 
> 
> But either she couldn't hear him or she didn't listen. As he watched, his wife and children jumped off the cliffs into the treacherous waters below. 
> 
> Crying out in shock, he desperately searched the waters for signs of them, but in vain. They had been claimed by the sea and their bodies were never found. 

## When The Tide Falls

> In a village south of Klalport, there lived a Dwarven innkeeper called Funda. 
> 
> Although tall for a Dwarf, Funda was shorter than many of the others in the village. He looked at the men around him and was insecure in his height, being so far from his mountain home.
> 
> The other men in the village would laugh at Funda. They would tease him for not being able to reach the high shelves in the general store, or pick the juciest apples from the orchards. Funda laughed along with them, but their words hurt. 
> 
> One night, when the wind was whipping against the shore, Funda heard a tapping at his door. A hideous old woman stood outside. "I am poor," she said, "but if you will let me shelter from the storm your kindness will be reimbursed."
> 
> Funda let the old woman in. As they got talking, he found he enjoyed talking to her. 
> 
> She was hungry, and so he gave her bread and cheese. She was cold, so he sat her by the fireplace. She smelled bad, so he offered to let her bathe and rest in one of the rooms of his inn for the night. 
> 
> The next morning he was disappointed to see that the old woman had gone. But the storm had moved on and so had she. 
> 
> Several days later, one of the local men was teasing Funda once more about his height. No longer able to laugh it off, Funda challenged the man. 
> 
> "I dare you to stand shoulder to shoulder with me in the sea. The tide will rise around us, and when the tide falls I will still be standing strong." 
> 
> The man laughed and agreed to the Dwarf's dare. 
> 
> The next day, they met at dawn on the beach. Together they stood, shoulder to shoulder, and the village watched as the sea water rose around them. Funda was covered before the other man, but it wasn't long before both were covered by the sea. 
> 
> The villagers watched, in shock as the tide fell, taking the man with it. But Funda was still standing. 
> 
> When they asked him how he'd survived, all he'd say is he'd had help from a friend. 

## The Pikes

> There was once a man called Asher. a baker who lived near the Pikes north of Klalport. 
> 
> Asher was known in his village for spending a lot of time in the woods on the mountainside. One day he came back notibly changed. His usually sunny disposition was clouded and he snapped at friends and family alike. 
> 
> He told them he'd seen things they couldn't possibly understand and to leave him alone. He became cold and distant. He stopped baking and spent longer and longer on the mountain. He errected a tall fence around his house so that no one could get close. 
> 
> At night though, people said they could hear him yelling at himself and crying out. 
> 
> One morning his closest neighbour realised her cat had gone missing. She went looking for it, calling for it everywhere but it never returned. 
> 
> Over the following days more neighbours' cats and dogs disappeared. Some people asked Asher if he'd seen them, but his response was only to mock them. 
> 
> Then, one evening, at sunset, while the sky was filled with reds and oranges and pinks, Asher knocked on his neighbour's door. He held out the dead body of her beloved cat, with tears streaming down his cheeks and told her he couldn't do it any more. He said that he could live with the things he was being forced to do during the day and he was sorry for the hurt he had caused. 
> 
> Standing in front of her, he drew a short sword from his belt, and stabbed himself in the heart.
