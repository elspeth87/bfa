> I hope this finds you well and that you are all enjoying your trip to Astrilton. I hate to bother you, especially so soon after you offered us such great service, but today I recieved a letter from a dear friend in need of help that I am unable to offer. Please find enclosed a copy of the letter she sent me.

> If this is not of interest, then of course I understand. It is one thing to fight back when one feels attacked and quite another to travel all the way to Cairngate to come to the aid of someone you've never met. 
> 
> Please let me know either way by return of post whether this is something you are willing to assist with so that I may let Brylwyn know whether or not she should look elsewhere. 
> 
> And, of course, should you ever visit Bramblestead again, I do hope you will pay me a visit.

> Gratefully yours,
