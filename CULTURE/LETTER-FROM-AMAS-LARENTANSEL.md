# LETTER FROM AMAS LARENTANSEL

>13 Eleasis 1355
>
>University of Astrilton
>
>For the Attention of those who came to my aid yesterday (Ambriel, Denots, Ermahgerd, Illias and Marprax), 
>
>Thank you once again for your assistance at the university. I believe that is twice now that you have saved my life. 
>
>It has been brought to my attention that I have been somewhat amiss in my method of compensation for your good deeds. While I am a fan of magical items and curios, it has been pointed out that there are some tasks for which thanks is better shown with gold. I'm not sure I entirely agree with this sentiment, but I recognise that we are all different and in addition your services yesterday, I came away from the whole experience feeling as though I had learned something. As I'm sure we can all agree, teachers deserve to be paid. 
>
>Therefore, in the pouch provided you will find 150gp as a token of my appreciation for your actions. 
>
>I believe you also agreed yesterday to deliver a letter to Cairngate for me. I was hoping to test your kindness somewhat and ask you to deliver two letters for me; the first to the Cairngate Magistrates, the second to Owain Boulderrock of Burrowforge. I have asked Prinoa to include a promissory note in each of them which will ensure the recipiant pays you, the deliverer, 10gp if they receive the letter no later than 17 Eleasis. I believe this should be sufficient time to reach our beloved capital and find what is required. 
>
>Apologies for not being able to deliver this in person. Today is a day of mourning for the town, and therefore Lily has agreed to deliver this on my behalf. Thank you, once more, adventurers. 
>
>May our paths cross again!
