## HOW THE HIGHLANDS DIED

[BACK](./CULTURE.md)

---

> When the world was younger than it is now, there was a garden. It was thick and green and covered many hundreds of miles of land. It was beautiful. The sort of place the sun never set and the gods smiled upon. 
> 
> Then the people came. They were jealous and greedy and unable to be happy with what they had. 
> 
> They saw the garden as something to be shaped and molded rather than something which was already complete. And as they tried to change it to their own ideals, the garden tried to fight back. But it was just a garden and not used to the extreme violence and reckless destruction wrought by the people. 
> 
> Slowly, the garden died. It withered beneath the angry hands of the people who sought to shape it for themselves, who couldn't see the beauty that was already there. 
> 
> But the garden wasn't done fighting. With its last breath, the garden shook the world, pushing mountains from the ground and toppling the buildings of men. 
> 
> This is how the Spindles were born and how the highlands died.
