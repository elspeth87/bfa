# EPRIA NEEDS YOU

It has been six years since Epria was finally freed from the tyranny of the Ardads. Six years, and in that time Epria is no better off than it was before. 

## OUR BRAVEST FELL

We fought long and hard for our freedom, and what do we have to show for it? Our dead are still dead. Our houses still burned and broken. Our children still hungry. 

### IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT FROM EPRIA?

## BETTER TO DIE BENEATH AN EPRIAN SKY

There are those amongst us who don't feel this pain. Who sit and ignore the cries of people homeless, the pain of a country still scarred by a long occupation. 

### WE CANNOT GIVE UP HOPE

There is still a chance that Epria may be great, and with **YOUR HELP** we can do it. 

## FREEDOM'S LIGHT MIGHT SHINE

But it can't unless everyone recognises the truth before them. 

### ALONE, THE PEOPLE OF EPRIA HAVE NO POWER 

## TOGETHER WE CAN

# TAKE THE POWER BACK
