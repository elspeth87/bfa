# Sunset's Claw


As cross the plains one warm Ches morn 
To a city fair rode I
There unarmed lines of fighting men 
In their hundreds passed me by
No pipe did hum no battle drum 
Did sound its call for war
But the thud of their heart before the battles start
Beat loud in the Sunset's Claw


Right proudly high over Klalport Town
They hung out the flag of war
'Twas better to die 'neath an Eprian sky
Than live under Ardadian law
And from the plains of the Great Gape
Strong men came fast when called
While Ardadian blades, Behind their baracades
Prepared in the Sunset's Claw

But the bravest fell, and the requiem bell
Rang mournfully and clear
For those who died in the morning tide
In the springing of the year
And the world did gaze, in deep amaze,
At those fearless men, but more
Would bear the fight that freedom's light
Might shine through the Sunset's Claw

Oh, back to the plain I rode again
And my heart with grief was sore
For I parted then with valiant men
Whom I never shall see more
But to and fro in my dreams I go
And I kneel and pray for war,
For the Ardads fled, O glorious dead,
When you fell in the Sunset's Claw
