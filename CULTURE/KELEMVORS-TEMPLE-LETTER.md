> My dearest love, 
>
> Words cannot describe the sorrow I feel. For the last fourteen years, Dian has been such a source of light and joy, but now, laying him to rest, it is as though he took the sun's rays with him. 
> 
> It's hard to think that the rest of the world is celebrating the Time of Flowers, while I am here in the darkness of Kelemvor's Temple under the Lisle Hills. I miss you, my love, and wish you were here by my side. 
> 
> Glask has blessed Dian. The ceremony was beautiful and although at first I thought this man may be a charlatan for the lengths we had to go to get Dian here, I see now he is trustworth. I'll admit, my love, it was in no small part due to the glowing amulet he wore for the ceremony which carried Kelemvor's symbol. He told me he only wears it for special ceremonies and although it may be a tall tale I'm inclined to believe him. In my grief I find I am more willing to believe what I'm told. It is a good thing you are minding the store, because I would be less than useless right now. 
> 
> My time here is almost at an end. Tomorrow I will lay our son to rest and then I will travel on to Klalport to see the sailspeople there. I will hope to be with you before Midsummer, so that I may dance with you beneath the gate. Please do not misunderstand my absence as neglect for you. I need time and I will return. I will always be... 
> 
> Forever yours,
