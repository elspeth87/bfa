> Of course, I would be more than happy to fulfil your order. It has been passed on to my foreman and we will see it done well and, perhaps more importantly, affordably. 
> 
> I'm sorry to hear of the hard times that you have experienced and have no doubt that you rose to the challenge. That said, what luck that you should meet such a group of helpful individuals. I wonder whether they might be able to help me with an issue I've been having. 
> 
> I won't go into the details here, but I seem to be somewhat shorter on gold than my ledger suggests I should be. I have my suspicions, but would appreciate the addition of several objective keen minds to help investigate where I can't. 
> 
> If you think the group you mentioned by be able to help, please do send them my way. They would, of course, be compensated for their time and efforts. 
> 
> Apologies for the brevity of this note. I will endevour to find time to write more soon, and look forward to seeing you in Marpenoth. 
> 
> Yours faithfully, 
> 
> Brylwyn
